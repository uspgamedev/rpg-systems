## Action Comparisons
### Melee Attack
| 3.5                                                     | 4                                                                          | 5                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Reach weapons cannot attack adjacent targets            | Reach weapons can reach adjacent targets                                   | Reach weapons can reach adjacent targets                  |
| Reach weapons threat reach area                         | Reach weapons threat only adjacent squares                                 | Reach weapons threat reach/adjacent area                  |
| Unarmed Attack provokes opportunity attack from target  | Unarmed Attack doesn't provoke opportunity attacks                         | Unarmed Attack doesn't provoke opportunity attacks        |
| No proficiency for Unarmed Attack for lethal damage     | No proficiency for Unarmed Attack                                          | Proficiency with Unarmed Attack                           |
| Unarmed Attack damage 1d3 bludgeoning, nonlethal        | Unarmed Attack damage 1d4                                                  | Unarmed Attack damage 1 bludgeoning                       |
| Two weapon fighting, any weapon, uses full round action | Two weapon fighting with an Off-hand Weapon only if a class feature allows | Two weapon fighting with a Light Weapon uses bonus action |

Observations!

1. Open dual wielding in 3.5, restricted by weapon type in 4 and 5. Additionally, 4 also requires a class feature.

2. Reach is bizarre. 5 is the simplest, which is you reach and threaten everything and stuff.

3. Unarmed was buffed from 3.5 to 4, and then nerfed in 5.

### Ranged Attack
| 3.5                                                              | 4                                                               | 5                                                                               |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| -2 on roll for each increment                                    | -2 if target is between normal and max range                    | Disadvantage if target is between normal and max range                          |
| -4 if target is engaged in melee with a friendly character       | No penalties on these cases                                     | Disadvantage if target is within 5 feet, can see you and is not incapacitated   |
| Provoke attack of opportunity from multiple threatening enemies  | Provoke attack of opportunity from multiple threatening enemies | Does not provoke an attack of opportunity                                       |
| Thrown weapons use Strength for damage roll                      | Heavy thrown weapons use Strength, light thrown use dexterity   | Thrown finesse weapons can choose Strength or Dexterity, the rest uses Strength |
| Projectile Weapons don't add modifier to damage roll             | Ranged Basic attack adds Dexterity modifier to damage roll      | Thrown finesse weapons can choose Strength or Dexterity, the rest uses Strength |
| Unusual thrown weapons deal weapon damage, crit 20/x2            | Unusual thrown one-handed weapons deal 1d4 damage               | Unusual thrown weapon deals 1d4 damage                                          |
| Free action for reloading bow/shuriken, Move action for the rest | Free action for load free, minor action for load                | Action or bonus action only for reload weapons                                          |
Observations!

1. The range mechanic is harsher in 3.5 and softer in 5, at the cost of being
   less instinctive and with the bonus of being easier to calculate.

2. We consider close-range ranged attacks harsher in 3.5 and 4, where there are
   opportunity attacks, even if in 5 the attack rolls with disadvantage.

3. Overall, ranged attack become safer in 5, and thus maybe stronger
